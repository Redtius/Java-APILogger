# Java-APILogger
A Simple Tool To Track APIs with a Log File.

# Todo
I'm planning to improve it by doing the Following:
* Make it a tool that could be used on Spring Boot.
* Make all Requests Types available.
* Make it track all the server APIs and log the results.
* Encrypt the data in the log and make it accessible for the admin only.

# The Future of the Tool

* This tool will be a great addition to maintain a big application, and detect when an error occurred.
